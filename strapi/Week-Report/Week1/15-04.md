# Day 2

Today's Task was to deploy Strapi backend on AWS EC2 using terraform only.The task was quite challenging as i only knew how to deploy resources but not to do configuration on fly.So Ilearned about user_data which helps us to run script when the ec2 starts. It was quite a challenging task.

Terraform files [Terraform](../../Terraform)

 #Commands Used 

 1) TO inisiate terraform in folder
 ```bash
 terraform init
 ```
 2) To check the plan of the main file
 ```bash
 terraform plan
 ```
 3) To apply the file
 ```bash
 terraform apply --auto-approve  
 ```
 4) To destroy all the resources.
```bash

 ```
