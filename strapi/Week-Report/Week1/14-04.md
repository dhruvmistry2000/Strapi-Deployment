# Day 1

Today I attended the session of the Training where I got to know what ar our goals and also the team solved all our doubt.
We were assigned with the task to deploy STRAPI locally and make a new Content type on the local machine.I opend the strapi website and started reading the documentation of that it is and how to deploy it. It was a simple command:-
 ```bash 
npx create-strapi-app@latest
```
then just use the following command to build the project and then see the web dashboard.
```bash
npm build 
```
```bash
npm run develop
```

After then I started exploring the dashboard and also i was going through the dir structure.
