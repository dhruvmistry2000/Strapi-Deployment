# Day 4
Today I have learned about GitHub Actions and how to create CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions. Additionally, I explored the recommended folder structure for organizing the `main.yml` file.

GitHub Actions are written in `.yml` format, and the folder structure is as follows:
```
.github/workflows/main.yml
```

I also learned about the various triggers, jobs, and steps that can be defined in a GitHub Actions workflow to automate tasks such as building, testing, and deploying code.
